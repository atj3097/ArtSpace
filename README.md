# ArtSpace 

### Introduction
ArtSpace is an immersive app where users can browse art available for sale and even preview on their walls. Independent artists can post their art and make it available for sale. Shoppers can view art and use an innovative augmented-reality feature to see how it would look in their home. 

## User Stories 
* Artiste: Independent artists can have trouble getting their work in front of potential buyers. An artiste using ArtSpace can post images of their art to a central marketplace where new buyers have a chance to discover them and purchase their art.

* Art Appreciator: Art Appreciators can use this app to find high-quality art outside of what is availble through mass-market retailers or expensive galleries and art dealers. They can preview the art in their home, and if they like it, set up an in-app purchase.
